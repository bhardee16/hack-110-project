Description:
Essentially, our 'website' allows the user to select a national park and see the activities held at the park.

Concepts Used:
Our project uses the National Parks Service API, dictionaries, functions (with parameters), and refrences.

Challenges / New Concepts:
Using an API was definately a challege, but with TA's coming around to help, we got through it. Our initial issue was that we weren't sure if the API was even being read in our program, so after we figured that out, we didn't know how to navigate through the data provided. Granted, the data provided was a dictionary of list of dictionarys, which we knew how to navigate through from class, but with such a large amount of data, it was a little confuing.

Team Members: Blake Hardee, Cooper Metts
Contributations: 
With this project, we tried to use GitHub to push and pull our advancments to each persons computer, but that didn't work, so we had to work on a single computer. With that being said, most of the implementation of the API was both team members, Blake did most of the page setups using HTML and Cooper worked on a lot of styling using css. 

Goals Achieved: 
For this project, we went with Cooper's proposal, which we honeslty thought would've taken a little less time than what we put into it. I mean, it is a simple website that pulls info from an API, which in theory sound reletively simple, but it wasn't. With that being said, we worked non-stop until we thought it was complete, ultimately meeting our goal.

Goals Outstanding / Future Work:
I think we met our goal with our initial proposal, because we didn't want to try to make something extremely complex. With future work, we could implement more aspects to return for each park, rather than just the activities. We could also style the website more, if we wanted.
